[Thesis [Russian]](https://github.com/SanjarNormuradov/SanjarNormuradov.github.io/tree/master/assets/pdf/projects/robotic_arm/BachelorThesisRus_NormuradovSN.pdf)

The content of this project is being updated...<br>

The development process consisted of three stages:<br>
<b>1. Mechanical Desgin/Manufacturing:</b><br>
I 3D designed and printed the robot's frame using CAD and FDM/FFF technologies on Tevo Flash/Tornado printers. I selected materials like PLA, PETG, TPU, and Nylon to enhance the robot's functionality and portability, addressing the inefficiency and weight issues of the existing model.
